# What to Do?
This app is designed to generate an activity to do based on input of what type of activity, how many people can it involve, price, and accessibility.

Simply customize the values, press generate, and an activity should show up!

The api is provided by [Bored Api](https://www.boredapi.com/)

# Deployment
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a free webhosting service that no longer needs the usage of a configuration file. "Whenever a new Deployment is created on Vercel, its source files will be retrieved from their origin location (a Git repository, for example) and processed within the [Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/build-step), after which they are made available on the [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview)." 

The app is available for viewing here: https://3140-lab4.vercel.app/

To run locally, download the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and then run 
```
vercel dev
```

# Logs
There isn't a deployment log that could be downloaded, so here are screenshots of automatic deployment from the first time the website created and then another time when the Github repository was updated.
